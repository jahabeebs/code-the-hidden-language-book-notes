Chapter 1: Best Friends
    Some strategies for non-verbal communication
        Bad: flashlight to draw letters
        Bad: blinks of light to communicate a specific letter (1 for A, etc.)
        Good: morse code

Chapter 2: Codes and Combinations
    Morse code introduction
        Invented 1837 and developed by others
        Goes hand in hand with telegraph invention
            Telegraph has similar hardware to a computer
        Number of codes = 2 ^ number of dots and dashes
            For example, 1 dot or dash can produce 2^1 different codes
        Morse code is considered binary because consists of dot & dash

Chapter 3: Braille and Binary Codes
    Creation of braille
        Charles Barbier, French army captain devised idea of "night writing"
            Raised dots on paper for sailors to pass notes in quiet
        Louis Braille liked concept of braille because it was easy to write
    Anatomy of braille
        Every symbol encoded in 2x3 cell and dots numbered 1-6
        Dots are binary--either raised or flat
        Can represent 64 unique codes
    Code errors
        Error when code is written: encoding error
        Error when code is read: decoding error
        Error when code is delivered: transmission error
    Precedence/shift codes & escape codes
        Shift codes: alter meaning of subsequent codes until shift ends
            Like holding down shift on keyboard
        Escape codes: alter only the following character

Chapter 4: Anatomy of a Flashlight
    Incandescent lightbulb
        Precursor to LED
        Filament made of tungsten that glows when electricity on
        Bulb filled w/inert gas to prevent tungsten from burning up
    Circuits are a circle
        Batteries must be connected in parallel rather than in series
        Combined voltage of 1.5 volts if each battery is 1.5 volts
        Atom w/electrons in outer shell are conducive to carrying electricity and called conductors
            Best conductors are copper, silver, and gold
            Opposite of conductance is resistance (resistors)
            Very high resistance is an insulator
            Longer wire -> higher resistance
            Thicker wire -> lower resistance (more electrons can move through wire)
    Electricity history
        Electron theory explains electricity as movement of electrons
        Electron & electricity derive from ancient Greek (elektron) which means amber
            Greeks generated static electricity by rubbing amber and wool
        Imbalance of protons and electrons will attempt to correct itself
        Electrons in a circuit are more orderly than in a lightning bolt because of clear passage
        Batteries have cathode (+) and anode (-) and converts chemical to electrical energy
    Voltage
        Voltage is potential for doing work
        Exists whether or not a battery is hooked up
    Current
        Related to # of electrons zipping around circuit and measured in amperes/amps
    Water and pipes analogy
        Current is similar to amount of water and voltage is similar to water pressure
        Resistance similar to width of pipe
    Ohm's law
        I = E/R
        I = current in amperes
        E = voltage (electromotive force)
        R = resistance
    Battery diagrams
        A squiggly line represents resistor--not a very low or high resistance
        Incandescent bulb has resistance of 4 ohms
    Watt 
        P = E * I
        P = power
    Switches
        Either electricity on or off--just like binary
        Closed switch = electricity flowing

Chapter 5: Communicating Around Corners
    Two flashlights, two batteries, three wires = bidirectional telegraph system
    Connection between two circuits called a common
    Can use the Earth instead of a common
        Earth is huge so can conduct well
        Need something with substantial contact to Earth like a buried large copper pole
        Called a "ground" in America
        Would only need wire between house and friend's house if using a high-voltage battery & bulb
        Two-way Morse code system can be constructed w/just two wires by using copper poles 
    Overcoming resistance
        Thickness of wire measured in American Wire Gauge (AWG)
        Smaller AWG = thicker wire = less resistance

Chapter 6: Logic with Switches
    Basis of Aristotle's logic was syllogism
        Two premises assumed to be correct and a conclusion is deduced
    George Boole
        Believed human brain uses logic so if we could represent logic we would know how the brain works
        Invented boolean algebra in which letters are operands and are combined with operators (+, x)
    Traditional algebra properties
        Addition and multiplication are commutative (we can switch around symbols on each side of operators)
        Subtraction and division are not commutative
        Addition and multiplication are associative
            A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C
        Multiplication is distributive over addition 
    Boole divorced algebra from concept of numbers
        Operands refer to classes not numbers
            Class is a group of things, similar to what a set is now considered
            Ex: M refers to class of male cats and F refers to class of female cats
        + symbol means union of two classes (M + F) = class of all cats that are male or female
        x symbol means intersection of two classes (M x F) = class of all cats that are BOTH male and female
        Commutative, associative, and distributive rules apply for Boolean algebra
        The symbol 1 means "the universe" or everything we're discussing
            M + F = 1 means the union of male and female cats is the class of all cats
            1 - M means the class of all cats except male cats
            1 - M = F means the universe excluding all male cats is same as the class of female cats
        The symbol 0 means an empty class, like when take an intersection of two exclusive classes
            F x M = 0 because there are no cats that are both male and female
    The roles of "or" and "and"
        + symbol can mean OR
        x symbol can mean AND
        1 - means NOT
    Circuitry and boolean logic
        Circuits can represent "and" and "or" via switches
        Switches connected in parallel don't both have to be closed for the circuit to work (represents OR)
        
Chapter 7: Telegraphs and Relays
    Morse (born 1791) relied on electromagnetism for long-distance communication
        An iron bar wrapped with thin, insulated, electrified wire will create a magnet
        Electromagnet is foundation of telegraph
            Turning switch on and off at one end causes electromagnet to do something at other end
    Telegraph was demoed publicly in 1843
        Telegraph used by holding and handle and tapping it up and down
        Short tap produces Morse code dot and long tap produces morse code dash
    Telegraph advancements
        Telegraph sounder used to create click clack noises
            Telegraph key was pressed, electromagnet pulled bar down to make a click noise
                Releasing key made a clack noise
            Fast click-clack = dot; slower click-clack was dash
    Repeater or relay
        Similar to a sounder because current is used to power electromagnet that pulls a lever
            Different because lever is used as part of a switch that connects battery to outgoing wire
        Amplifies weak incoming current to create stronger outgoing current
