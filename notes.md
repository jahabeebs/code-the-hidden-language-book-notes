Chapter 1: Best Friends
    Some strategies for non-verbal communication
        Bad: flashlight to draw letters
        Bad: blinks of light to communicate a specific letter (1 for A, etc.)
        Good: morse code

Chapter 2: Codes and Combinations
    Morse code introduction
        Invented 1837 and developed by others
        Goes hand in hand with telegraph invention
            Telegraph has similar hardware to a computer
        Number of codes = 2 ^ number of dots and dashes
            For example, 1 dot or dash can produce 2^1 different codes
        Morse code is considered binary because consists of dot & dash

Chapter 3: Braille and Binary Codes
    Creation of braille
        Charles Barbier, French army captain devised idea of "night writing"
            Raised dots on paper for sailors to pass notes in quiet
        Louis Braille liked concept of braille because it was easy to write
    Anatomy of braille
        Every symbol encoded in 2x3 cell and dots numbered 1-6
        Dots are binary--either raised or flat
        Can represent 64 unique codes
    Code errors
        Error when code is written: encoding error
        Error when code is read: decoding error
        Error when code is delivered: transmission error
    Precedence/shift codes & escape codes
        Shift codes: alter meaning of subsequent codes until shift ends
            Like holding down shift on keyboard
        Escape codes: alter only the following character
