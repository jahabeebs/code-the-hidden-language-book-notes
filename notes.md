Chapter 1: Best Friends
    Some strategies for non-verbal communication
        Bad: flashlight to draw letters
        Bad: blinks of light to communicate a specific letter (1 for A, etc.)
        Good: morse code

Chapter 2: Codes and Combinations
    Morse code introduction
        Invented 1837 and developed by others
        Goes hand in hand with telegraph invention
            Telegraph has similar hardware to a computer
        Number of codes = 2 ^ number of dots and dashes
            For example, 1 dot or dash can produce 2^1 different codes
        Morse code is considered binary because consists of dot & dash

Chapter 3: Braille and Binary Codes
    Creation of braille
        Charles Barbier, French army captain devised idea of "night writing"
            Raised dots on paper for sailors to pass notes in quiet
        Louis Braille liked concept of braille because it was easy to write
    Anatomy of braille
        Every symbol encoded in 2x3 cell and dots numbered 1-6
        Dots are binary--either raised or flat
        Can represent 64 unique codes
    Code errors
        Error when code is written: encoding error
        Error when code is read: decoding error
        Error when code is delivered: transmission error
    Precedence/shift codes & escape codes
        Shift codes: alter meaning of subsequent codes until shift ends
            Like holding down shift on keyboard
        Escape codes: alter only the following character

Chapter 4: Anatomy of a Flashlight
    Incandescent lightbulb
        Precursor to LED
        Filament made of tungsten that glows when electricity on
        Bulb filled w/inert gas to prevent tungsten from burning up
    Circuits are a circle
        Batteries must be connected in parallel rather than in series
        Combined voltage of 1.5 volts if each battery is 1.5 volts
        Atom w/electrons in outer shell are conducive to carrying electricity and called conductors
            Best conductors are copper, silver, and gold
            Opposite of conductance is resistance (resistors)
            Very high resistance is an insulator
            Longer wire -> higher resistance
            Thicker wire -> lower resistance (more electrons can move through wire)
    Electricity history
        Electron theory explains electricity as movement of electrons
        Electron & electricity derive from ancient Greek (elektron) which means amber
            Greeks generated static electricity by rubbing amber and wool
        Imbalance of protons and electrons will attempt to correct itself
        Electrons in a circuit are more orderly than in a lightning bolt because of clear passage
        Batteries have cathode (+) and anode (-) and converts chemical to electrical energy
    Voltage
        Voltage is potential for doing work
        Exists whether or not a battery is hooked up
    Current
        Related to # of electrons zipping around circuit and measured in amperes/amps
    Water and pipes analogy
        Current is similar to amount of water and voltage is similar to water pressure
        Resistance similar to width of pipe
    Ohm's law
        I = E/R
        I = current in amperes
        E = voltage (electromotive force)
        R = resistance
    Battery diagrams
        A squiggly line represents resistor--not a very low or high resistance
        Incandescent bulb has resistance of 4 ohms
    Watt 
        P = E * I
        P = power
    Switches
        Either electricity on or off--just like binary
        Closed switch = electricity flowing

Chapter 5: Communicating Around Corners
    Two flashlights, two batteries, three wires = bidirectional telegraph system
    Connection between two circuits called a common
    Can use the Earth instead of a common
        Earth is huge so can conduct well
        Need something with substantial contact to Earth like a buried large copper pole
        Called a "ground" in America
        Would only need wire between house and friend's house if using a high-voltage battery & bulb
        Two-way Morse code system can be constructed w/just two wires by using copper poles 
    Overcoming resistance
        Thickness of wire measured in American Wire Gauge (AWG)
        Smaller AWG = thicker wire = less resistance
